# To Add
- Write an initial quiz program that allows you to pick which topic you would like to be quizzed on.
- Maybe use the flags library for it?
- Write a universal package with helper functions that allow you to construct the quiz in every repo. The flag might be a required argument in one of the functions. But it need not necessarily be part of the library.
- Write a production-ready (to be consumed by other devs) version of this quiz package
